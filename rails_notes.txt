**HTTP Authentication**

At the top of your controller:
```ruby
http_basic_authenticate_with name: "admin", password: "conifer1", only: [:index]
```

**Email Regex**
```ruby
email_address.scan(/\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i)
```

**Custom Error Messages**
```ruby
en:
  hello: "Hello world"
  activerecord:
    attributes:
      post:
        primary_image_id: "Image of view"
        secondary_image_id: "Image of feet"
        title: "A title"
        description: "A description"
    errors:
      messages:
        confirmation: "Passwords do not match"
      models:
        post:
          attributes:
            primary_image_id:
              blank: "You must add a view image to create a post"
            secondary_image_id:
              blank: "You must add an image of your feet to create a post"
            title:
              blank: "A title is required to create a post"
            description:
              blank: "A description is required to create a post"
```

**Adding an Avatar: Paperclip + S3**

Step 1: Add paperclip:

https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip

```ruby
gem 'paperclip'
```

In terminal:
```
bundle install
```

In your model:
```ruby
attr_accessible :avatar

has_attached_file :avatar, :styles => { :medium => "300x300>", :thumb => "100x100>" }
```

You will need to add an image to your assets/images folder to act as a default image if the user has not yet uploaded their avatar. In this example we will use a file titled: missing_avatar.png

In terminal:
```
rails g migration AddAvatarColumnsToUser
```

```ruby
class AddAvatarColumnsToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_attachment :users, :avatar
  end
end
```

In terminal:
```
rake db:migrate
```

In your edit and new views:
```
<%= image_tag user.avatar.url(:medium) %>
<%= form_for @user, :url => users_path, :html => { :multipart => true } do |form| %>
  <%= form.file_field :avatar %>
<% end %>
```

If you're going to use Amazon S3 to store image:
```ruby
gem 'aws-sdk'
```

In terminal:
```
bundle install
```

In config/environments/development.rb and config/environments/production.rb:
```ruby
config.paperclip_defaults = {
:default_url => "missing_avatar.png",
:storage => :s3,
:s3_credentials => {
  :bucket => ENV['AWS_BUCKET'],
  :access_key_id => ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY'],
  :secret_access_key => ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
  }
}
```

You can go to Amazon S3 and set up an account if you haven't already to get these ENV variables. Make sure to set the ENV variables in a .env file or you can do what I always do which is install the gem figaro which gives you an application.yml file to put your ENV variables in and automatically adds it to .gitignore.
